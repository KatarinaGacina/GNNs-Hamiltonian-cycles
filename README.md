### Supplementary code for "Finding Hamiltonian cycles with Graph neural networks"

Clone and run train.py to get the evaluation of "HamS" and "HamR" models presented in the paper. Running generate_figures.py will generate figures of Erdos-Renyi graphs similar to those presented in the paper.


### Requirements:
* [Python](https://www.python.org/) 3.8 or later
* [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/) 1.8 or later
* [PyTorch geometric](https://pytorch-geometric.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) 1.6.3 or later
* [Concorde TSP solver](http://www.math.uwaterloo.ca/tsp/concorde.html)

### Usage
* Running train.py loads HamS and HamR models from WEIGHTS folder and evaluates them on graphs stored in DATA folder. Removing all .pt files from WEIGHTS folder will instead first train both HamS and HamR models.
* Running generate_figures.py will generate figures from the paper for two examples.
* The respository contains only a small sample of data in DATA folder. A sample similar to the one used in paper can be generated by running generate_data.py. **This requires exact solvers, see below**


#### Exact solvers
Finding exact solutions requires that "Concorde TSP" is installed on the system.
In that case config.cfg has to be adjusted to point to "concorde" executable.

It contains the following fields (only the first field needs to be changed):
* CONCORDE_SCRIPT_PATH - path to "concorde" executable
* CONCORDE_WORK_DIR - temporary directory (preferably empty) where intermediate inputs and outputs from concorde are created (it is cleaned automatically) 
* CONCORDE_INPUT_FILE - name of the input file which is created and used as input to concorde
